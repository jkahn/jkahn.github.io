I have a bunch of things I'd like to write up reviews for. This page
puts some of them in writing, even if as weak promissory notes

"Hard" SF
---------

- The *Ancillary* trilogy

- *The Midas Flesh*

- *Finder: Third World*

- *The Expanse* and how I owe Emily F. an apology


Uncomfortable almost-fiction about the almost-present
-----------------------------------------------------

- *The Drowned World*

- *Distrust That Particular Flavor* and *The Peripheral* (and their
   relationship to `git log --graph`).

- *Transmetropolitan* and 2016

Fantasy
-------

- *Uprooted*

- *The Fifth Season*, *Anvil of the World*, and *Throne of the Crescent Moon*
