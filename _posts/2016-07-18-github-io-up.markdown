I'm planning to use the Github IO pages to maintain some projects that
are less well-suited for my [trochee.net](http://trochee.net/), and
because it's much easier to maintain in github.  Since the code is all
in git, I feel more comfortable having some of it hosted than I have before.

I hope to include:

* useful guides and indexes of nifty tech projects
* wishlists of things I want to explore
* Pages coordinating projects I'm working on
